# Auto-Parking-Algorithm
Designed an Auto parking algorithm using state machine model and implemented it in a RC car. The vehicle moves in a straight line till finding a possible place for parallel parking, it assesses if the place matches the minimum required dimensions for a successful parking operation then it takes the decision whether to park or to keep moving searching for another alternative.During parking it also assesses if there is any misalignment to readjust itself.
